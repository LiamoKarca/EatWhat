This guide explains how to package the EatWhat project into an executable (.exe) file for Windows operating systems. Follow these steps to create an executable version of the project using PyInstaller.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the `pyinstaller` package.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Packaging the Project

1. **Modify main.spec File**: Make necessary modifications to the `main.spec` file based on the prompts provided within the file, especially adjusting file paths.

2. **Run PyInstaller**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pyinstaller main.spec
    ```

3. **Locate Executable**: After running PyInstaller, two directories will be generated: `build` and `dist`. The `EatWhat.exe` file will be present within the `dist` directory.

4. **Run the Executable**: Double-click `EatWhat.exe` to launch the application.

### Sharing the Executable

If you want to share the executable with friends or family, consider the following recommendations:

- **Cloud Storage**: Upload the file to platforms like Dropbox for sharing. Avoid using Google Drive to prevent potential detection as a virus.
  
- **USB Drive**: Alternatively, share the file via USB drive and instruct the recipient to install it.

### Security Considerations

Before running the executable, ensure to take necessary security precautions to prevent false positives from Windows Defender:

1. **Exclude from Windows Defender**: Add the executable file to the exclusion list of Windows Defender to prevent it from being flagged as a virus.
   
   - Navigate to Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Virus & Threat Protection Settings > Exclusions > Add or remove exclusions.

2. **Adjust Security Settings**: Modify Windows Security settings as needed to ensure smooth execution of the application.
